d on Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley and Blades in the Dark by John Harper.
Rules
An investigation group consists of 1-3 Investigators who attempt to uncover the dark truths, as well as a Keeper of Dark Truths and communicates on behalf of the world, including all other people, creatures, and phenomena.
Character Creation
Every character has three labels: an occupation, like Laborer or Librarian, and two broader personal traits, like Reads Latin or Motorcyclist. They start with 0 Insight.

Take three items related to your labels with you. This might include a revolver, a field forensics kit, a reference work of occult practices, an address book with local contacts, a tactical flashlight, a set of walkie-talkies, etc.
Trying
When investigating or taking a risky action, gather dice:

+1d if a label applies
+1d if within normal human capabilities
+1d if you have help from another investigator who shares risk
-1d if a condition applies
-1d if some specific external drawback applies

Regardless of how many labels apply or how many investigators assist, you only get 1 die for either of those. Similarly, regardless of how many conditions apply, you only lose one die. On less than 1 die, roll 2 dice and use the lower result.

The Keeper may tell you that you risk increasing your Insight. If you are using an arcana, or dealing with any otherworldly phenomena or creatures, Insight will be at risk. All arcana have an Insight rating; if you do not meet that minimum, then this will be treated as an external drawback.

Look at the highest die in the result:
1-3: Things get worse. You may still succeed at the Keeper's discretion, but some complication arises or gets worse, or you take a condition. If death is on the table, you die.
4-5: You succeed as well as can be expected, but a minor complication arises or gets slightly worse. If death is on the table, you are severely wounded and need major medical care.
6: You succeed with no significant consequences. If Insight is at risk, make an Insight roll.

Regardless of the result, if a clue is required to progress the investigation, you find it. But the costs might be high!

include probability notes
Insight
When making a risk / investigation roll including an Insight die, if no other die rolls higher than your Insight, make an Insight roll.

To make an Insight roll, roll 1 die.. If it is higher than your current Insight, increase that value by 1. Some arcana (e.g. grimoires) can increase your Insight permanently.
If your Insight is already at 6 and would increase, the Keeper will work with you to define a condition (possibly reflecting otherworldly influence), similar to conditions you may take from partial successes or failures.

In social interactions, if your Insight is at least 2 more than the other person's, subtract a die as per the specific external drawback note above. Most normal humans are at 0 Insight. Conspiracy theorists and other investigators are usually at 2-4.

Insight is permanent and may not be reduced.
Fighting
Generally, any fights are resolved using the procedure for a risky action. When fighting otherworldly creatures, simply defeating them in combat is not possible and will lead to your death. Instead, define a specific goal you want to achieve (e.g. escaping from the creatures or binding them). The Keeper will let you know if the goal is achievable or if any drawbacks apply.
Keeper Advice
Make sure investigators know the stakes, or at least the magnitude of them, before a roll. They don't need to know the exact details in advance - that's what makes it an investigation - but they should have the ability to judge risk versus reward.

Write conditions that present significant drawbacks but are not insurmountable. Where possible, lean on the weird and otherworldly.

Each scenario should have one or two arcana - items that benefit from (and potentially increase) Insight. These might include a grimoire with dark spells, a bestiary of several creatures from outside our world, a piece of odd technology operating according to no known scientific principles, etc.
Scenarios (EXTREMELY WIP)
Define a central dark truth, such as "a small cabal of believers will attempt to summon a demon outside a church in five days' time." Determine what consequence could be associated with this dark truth, such as "if the demon is summoned, hellish fire will consume the area".

Then select several interesting, thematic locations, such as:

The home of one of the believers
A private library of the occult
A small rural cemetery
The church

Then, for each location, write at least two clues that point to other locations and at least one that points to the dark truth. This might include information to be gained from talking to people, physical evidence, and events that happen. Decide which clue will start the investigation (e.g. the grimoire theft) and how the investigators are involved.

This is just a basic overview of key points in writing investigative scenarios. Find the advice that works best for you and use it!

Alternatively, take an existing scenario from another game such as Call of Cthulhu. Ensure that you understand the information to be found at each location or from significant people, how it can be gained, and what the motivations or agendas for each character are.
