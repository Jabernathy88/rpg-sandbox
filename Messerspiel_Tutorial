Okay, here's how you play.

ALMOST ALWAYS

You will roll **1 dark die** (your stress die). You are always stressed.

And **1 light die** (your "healthy" die).

| If you are *_wounded_, you do not roll this first light die.

MOST OF THE TIME

Add **+1 die** to your pool, one for each of the following situations, up to your current MAX POOL:

* Your profession or background gives you some kind applicable skill
* An ally assists you with this task and shares the risk of failure
* You have a tool or specialized equipment that makes this easier
* Situational leverage you have discussed with GM.
