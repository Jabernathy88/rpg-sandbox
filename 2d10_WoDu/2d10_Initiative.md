## Combat Initiative

The GM may rule that some characters are ready or surprised based on what's happening in the current scene. As always, these rulings should be consistent and fair. If unsure, consult the optional dice mechanics below.

### Rounds

During Round 1 of combat, all characters are either **surprised** -or- **ready now**.

  **Round 1**: The spotlight starts with players who are ready now. Then resolve the actions of enemies who are ready now. Skip all other characters who are surprised. All effects related to surprise wear off at the end of this round.

  **Round 2**: Characters are no longer surprised. The spotlight goes to all of the players first, and all enemies may act as normal.

  **Round 3**: And so on, players first and enemies last, as normal.

### Enemies

If this is a very small battle, consider a common sense ruling, or simplify the odds by choosing two options below and rolling high or low.

The GM rolls **1d6** for all enemies and may include a **+1** or **-1** modifier based on the fiction. If rolling in the open, declare this bonus beforehand. It's a good idea to make these numbers known to players if you've committed to multiple sessions or a campaign.

 * **1**:	**All** enemies are surprised.
 * **2-3**: **Half** of the enemies are surprised. The rest are ready now. The GM chooses which enemies are surprised and may round up or down as they wish. 
 * **4-5**: **One** enemy is surprised. The rest are ready now. The GM chooses which. If this is a very large battle, consider choosing a small group of enemies.
 * **6**:	**All** enemies are ready now.

_(Knowing which enemies are surprised might be a factor in setting difficulty for the players' roll below.)_

### Players

The default difficulty is **Fair (13+)**. The GM may raise or lower the difficulty based on the fiction, as well as the Ability Ratings of the most experienced enemy who is unsurprised and ready now. If unsure, make a common sense ruling and keep the action moving.

Each player rolls DEX:

 * **13+	Fair**:	You are **ready now** — you may act during Round 1, and you have advantage on rolls to attack enemies who are surprised.
 * **12-**:			You are  **surprised** — during Round 1, you do not get a spotlight, and you have disadvantage on rolls to defend against enemies who are ready now.

_(The GM may call for a different stat based on the fiction. For example, if it's a courtly social challenge, initiative based on WIT or CHA might make sense.)_
