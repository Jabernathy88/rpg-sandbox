,"The dice notation d6+ means ""Roll two d6 and keep the highest one.""",,,,
,You roll one extra die for each plus symbol. So d6++ means roll two extra dice (3d6 in total) and keep the highest single result.,,,,
,"In my head, d6++ is pronounced ""dee six plus plus,"" but you do you.",,,,
,,,,,
,"By contrast, d6– means ""Roll two d6 and keep the lowest,"" and d6–– means to roll 3d6 and keep the lowest.",,,,
,"If reading out loud, I pronounce these like ""dee six minus"" and ""dee six minus minus.""",,,,
,"In the full rules text, these notations will have color-coding and formatting for visual clarity.",,,,
,,,,,
,"These bonuses stack (as in the example of multiple attackers), but you only ever keep the one highest die result.",,,,
,"I like to think of each plus as a bonus die, and each minus as a penalty die.",,,,
,"If rules interact such that there both plus and minus symbols, each bonus cancels out one penalty.",,,,
