CORE RESOLUTION

Simple Version
Roll 2d10 + Ability Rating. If your total is equal to 12 or higher, you succeed. 

DR: Simple Pass or Fail
As in the example above, the default difficulty rating is DR:12. The abbreviation “DR“ simply stands for “difficulty rating” (or “dice roll” if that’s easier) and indicates the target number. If your total roll equals the DR or higher, you succeed. 

Light		Risky		Hard		Extreme	Mythic
DR:	9		12		15		18		21

Use this type of roll if the fiction calls for a simple check: pass or fail. This style will be comfortable if you are accustomed to d20 games. 

FR: Fuzzy Range and Mixed Success
The GM may assign a “fuzzy range” or “FR” indicating weak success if you roll within a three-number range. If you roll above the fuzzy range, you pass with strong success. 

Risky		Hard		Extreme	Mythic
FR:	9-11		12-14		15-17		18-20

For example, the default fuzzy range is FR:12-14. If your total roll equals 12, 13, or 14, that indicates a weak success — the GM will offer a positive outcome with a complication, cost, or reduced effect. Any roll equal to 15 or higher counts as a strong success. Rolling an 11 or less means failure with specific consequences, also known as a hard move.

This roll represents a gradient, or degrees of success, within the fiction — especially if you declare dramatic consequences for failure beyond simply “you miss.” This style will be comfortable if you have experience with Powered by the Apocalypse games.

There’s nothing wrong with using both styles from time to time. But if you’re ever unsure, lean toward the PbtA convention of fail-forward and use the fuzzy range.

Keep in mind that starting characters should probably encounter mostly light, risky, and hard challenges. Be careful how you describe extreme or mythic difficulty — some challenges should be impossible, even for the most powerful characters, and even with a lucky roll. If unsure, look to the fiction when deciding if a dice roll makes practical sense.
