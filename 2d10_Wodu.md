Working Title:
“2d10 WoDu Hack”
By J.E. Abernathy

Light RPG rules inspired World of Dungeons and KULT …. This is a fan creation for personal use and not for sale. And … it’s not done!

ABILITY RATINGS

This game uses 4 abilities rather — than the traditional 6 in World of Dungeons.

Ability		Abrev.		Helper Text					
Strength	STR		Stamina, Brute Force, Close Combat			
Dexterity	DEX		Agility, Quick Precision, Ranged Combat		
Wits		WIT		Learning, Logic, Sensory Perception			
Charisma	CHA		Willpower, Confidence, Social Perception			

CONSIDER using 3 defensive abilities: Fort, Reflex, Will. And do the rest as skills or proficiencies?

(The char gen section has been moved further below.)

NO BASIC MOVES

In the spirit of World of Dungeons, there are no basic moves in this game. Adjudicating outcomes of conflict should feel like a conversation. GMs are encouraged to make decisions in the moment, with the goal of consistency, fairness, and fun.


CORE RESOLUTION

Simple Version
Roll 2d10 + Ability Rating. If your total is equal to 12 or higher, you succeed. 

DR: Simple Pass or Fail
As in the example above, the default difficulty rating is DR:12. The abbreviation “DR“ simply stands for “difficulty rating” (or “dice roll” if that’s easier) and indicates the target number. If your total roll equals the DR or higher, you succeed. 

Light		Risky		Hard		Extreme	Mythic
DR:	9		12		15		18		21

Use this type of roll if the fiction calls for a simple check: pass or fail. This style will be comfortable if you are accustomed to d20 games. 

FR: Fuzzy Range and Mixed Success
The GM may assign a “fuzzy range” or “FR” indicating weak success if you roll within a three-number range. If you roll above the fuzzy range, you pass with strong success. 

Risky		Hard		Extreme	Mythic
FR:	9-11		12-14		15-17		18-20

For example, the default fuzzy range is FR:12-14. If your total roll equals 12, 13, or 14, that indicates a weak success — the GM will offer a positive outcome with a complication, cost, or reduced effect. Any roll equal to 15 or higher counts as a strong success. Rolling an 11 or less means failure with specific consequences, also known as a hard move.

This roll represents a gradient, or degrees of success, within the fiction — especially if you declare dramatic consequences for failure beyond simply “you miss.” This style will be comfortable if you have experience with Powered by the Apocalypse games.

There’s nothing wrong with using both styles from time to time. But if you’re ever unsure, lean toward the PbtA convention of fail-forward and use the fuzzy range.

Keep in mind that starting characters should probably encounter mostly light, risky, and hard challenges. Be careful how you describe extreme or mythic difficulty — some challenges should be impossible, even for the most powerful characters, and even with a lucky roll. If unsure, look to the fiction when deciding if a dice roll makes practical sense.



Alternate DR — 02/21/22

GOOD			STRONG			EXTREME		MYTHIC		
DR:	12+			16+			20+			24+		

Alternate FR — 02/21/22

ALMOST GOOD		ALMOST STRONG	ALMOST EXTREME	ALMOST MYTHIC		
FR:	9-11			13-15			17-19			21-23			




May decide to stick to simply: Good, Strong, Extreme, Mythic for both DR and FR. Looks a little like Call of Cthulhu…?

CHARACTER GENERATION

Character Generation
Start your character at Level 1. For your starting Ability Ratings, distribute 2, 1, 1, -1. Then:
At each level, your Max HP is calculated as Current Level + 10 + STR. 
Choose or roll for your Background, or make up your own.
Choose a Special Move appropriate for your Background.
Choose or roll for Equipment, or make up your own.

For gritty characters
Start your character at Level 0. For your starting Ability Ratings, distribute 1, 0, 0, -1. Leave your Background blank or choose something more ordinary. Your Max HP is 5 + STR. Good luck!

Then at Level 1, reassign your Ability Ratings with 2, 1, 1, -1. Choose a normal Background. Calculate your Max HP as normal: 11 + STR. As a group, you might want to discuss advancing the story with a slight “time skip,” perhaps 1-6 months to reflect a short period of training. (See more under ADVANCEMENT below.)

BACKGROUND 

Table forthcoming. I will probably base the backgrounds on Cairn and Electric Bastionland. Examples: Soldier, Pilot, Scientist, Psychic. (What’s your profession? What makes your character special in this story?)

Add an extra d10 to a your roll when your Background applies, keeping the highest two dice. For example, if your Background is “Getaway Driver,” and you are trying to maneuver a motorcycle to avoid gunfire, roll 3d10k2 + DEX. (The dice notation “k2” means that you keep the highest two out of the three dice rolled.) 


	
ADVANCEMENT

All XP decisions are ultimately up to the GM. Feel free to discuss and revisit the decision, however, between sessions or story arcs as needed.

Fast or Slow
As a group, discuss whether you prefer slow or fast advancement: 
If the group chooses fast advancement, a character needs 10 XP to reach the next level.
With slow advancement, the requirement is 15 XP to level up.

Keep in mind, if a character earns an average of 4 XP per session, fast advancement will take about 20–25 sessions to reach 10th level, while the slow option takes about 35–40.

As a suggestion, good times to reflect are around 5th and 10th level. Consider using a time skip to help transition between story arcs with different pacing or narrative tone.

Group XP
At the end of each session, the group as a whole can earn 1–4 XP per session. As a group, discuss whether you prefer to use:
XP Bingo (handout forthcoming)  
End of Session questions from your favorite PbtA game(s)

Individual XP
Additionally, each PC can earn 0–2 XP per session for:
taking interesting risks (whether they succeed or not) 
creative, positive, and group-oriented roleplay and/or collaborative world-building
Such XP can be awarded immediately, in the moment, or at the end of the session. Discuss with your group which option seems fun and makes the most sense.

Chapter Bonus
At the end of a multi-session arc, consider awarding a chapter bonus of 1–4 XP for the whole group. Also, consider awarding this bonus to PCs who were absent and might need help catching up during the next arc.

	


SPECIAL MOVES

TBD, forthcoming. I’ll probably just borrow playbook moves from other PbtA games, and you are welcome to experiment, as well.

DAMAGE & POWERS

If needed, I’ll abbreviate these Weapon Ratings as “WR,” so they can be referenced with WR:0, WR:1, etc., sort of like FATE Condensed.

	Rating (WR) 	Example				DMG					
0		—					1 	
1		Civilian punch (untrained)		2d6▼k1  (roll 2 dice, keep lowest 1)	
	2		Baseball bat				d6 melee	
Chef’s knife				d6 melee or ranged			
3		Fireaxe, katana			d10 melee
Revolver				d10 ranged				
Shotgun				d10 blast		
Dual swords, twin pistols		2d10▲k1  (roll 2 dice, keep highest 1)	

			Hero Power									
3+1		Optic Laser Beam  (as revolver +1)	d10 +1 ranged	
Mutant Claws  (as dual swords +1)	2d10▲k1 +1 melee			

Upgrades purchased through “Special Moves” will replace the +1 bonus with a +2. The max will be +4, I think. These bonuses apply to damage only, not any rolls “to hit.”. More examples TBD.

Also (GM’s option) 										
4		Sniper rifle 				2d10 ranged
Grenade				2d10 blast				
5		Helicopter minigun			3d10 blast
	6		C-4					4d10 blast						

## Initiative

The GM rolls 1d6 for all enemies and, before the roll, may declare a +1 or -1 modifier based on the fiction.
 * **1-3**:	One enemy -or- all enemies are surprised _(GM's choice)_. Any other enemies are simply ready.
 * **4-6**:	One enemy -or- all enemies have a head start. The rest are simply ready and not surprised.

Each player rolls DEX.
 * **16+	Great**:	You have a **head start** — you may act during Round 1, and you have advantage on rolls to attack against enemies who are surprised.

 * **13+	Fair**:		You are  **simply ready** — you do not get a spotlight during Round 1 of combat, but you are not considered surprised and do not suffer any disadvantage related to initiative.

 * **12-**:					You are  **surprised** — during Round 1 of combat, you do not get a spotlight and you have disadvantage on rolls to defend against enemies who have a head start.

_(The GM may call for a different stat based on the fiction. For example, if it's a courtly social challenge, initiative based on WIT or CHA might make sense.)_

**Round 1**: Spotlight starts with players who have a head start. Then resolve the actions of enemies who have a head start. Skip all other characters, including those who are simply ready or surprised. The benefit of having a head start wears off at the end of this round.

**Round 2**: Spotlight goes to all of the players first, and then all enemies may act as normal. Characters are no longer surprised, so any initiative-related advantages and disadvantages do not apply.

**Round 3**: And so on, players first and enemies last, as normal.
