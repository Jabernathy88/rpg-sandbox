# City of Mist Accelerated

System will be a lightweight, custom version of _FATE Accelerated Edition_. Combines some small ideas from _Tunnel Goons_, _World of Dungeons_, _KULT_, and of course, _City of Mist_, the RPG by Amít Moshe.

## Summary

This world is like the comic book _Fables_ meets the tv show _Miami Vice_. 

Essentially it's a setting drift of **_City of Mist_** transported to a fictional version of 1980s Miami, Florida. The players are associated with a private detective agency located somewhere around South Beach, Wynwood, or Little Havana. The world of fables is real — hidden as if behind a tropical mist. 

Threats might include a ghost pirate ship kidnapping tourists along the Caribbean beaches, or a gang of teenage ninja Kappa hiding in the sewers. Mysteries of myth coexist and intermingle with more mundane dangers including Italian Cosa Nostra or the Columbian cartel.

## Week 1: Pitch Points & Inspiration!

### What to know before you play

 **1.** **Each player character has a "mythos"** — a mystical force that gives you extraordinary abilities. This mythos is usually based on a fable or legendary archetype such as Gilgamesh, Amaterasu, or Quetzalcóatl. Your character also has a **"logos"**, which represents your mundane human identity and your obliglations to family or community. So, for example, during the daytime you might be a humble car mechanic, but by night, you fight crime as the modern incarnation of Hephaestus, God of the Forge.

 **3.** **Pitch Point 3** — lorem ipsem, placeholder.

### Inspiration: Player Facing

 **1.** **City of Mist** — specifically the City of Mist Player's Guide, Starter Set.

 **2.** **Miami Vice** and Burn Notice — tv shows set in Miami with a similar vibe. Characters take on "cases" to defend the weak, explore the urban environment, chat up locals for gossip, and the occasional boat ride outside the city (both ocean and swamp).
 
 **3.** **Jessica Jones** — tv show featuring and imperfect superhero / private eye. More street-level threats rather than big global villains. Private Detective agencies. 
 Also: **Dare Devil** and season 1 of **Young Justice**.
 
 **4.** **Fables** — comic book similar to how superpowers are explained in _City of Mist_. 
 Also: **American Gods** by Neil Gaiman. 

### Inspiration: GM Facing

 **1.** **City of Mist: Nights of Payne Town** campaign compilation — might try to adapt some of these scenarios such as "Killing Her Softly" and other surreal crime-noir mysteries.

 **2.** **Augmented Reality** — solid quality random tables for generating cyberpunk settings, but some is applicable to a retro urban fantasy environment.

 **3.** **Electric Bastionland** — advice and procedures for creating city buroughs and dungeon-esque mapping in unusual urban environments.
 
#### Honorable Mentions

 - **Google Earth and Wikipedia** — because I'm adapting a real-world location into an original fictional universe. 
 - **Dexter, True Blood** — the tv shows set in Miami and Louisiana hinting at a tropical Southern gothic mood.
 - **Watchmen / Tales of the Black Freighter** — the "easter egg" story of a gentleman who transforms into a degenerate pirate, a frame narrative inside of _Watchmen_ by Alan Moore.
 - **1980s Swamp Thing** — wonderful comic books series that rebooted the swampland anti-hero, also written by Alan Moore.
 - __Godfather movies__ — interesting portrayal of the Cuban Revolution (in Godfather Part 2, I think) set against the backdrop of Caribbean geopolitics and Italian organized crime.
 - **Narcos, Breaking Bad**, movies about Pablo Escabar — stories of drug cartels and the rise and fall of dynasties wihin
