# City of Mist Accelerated

System will be a lightweight, custom version of FATE Accelerated Edition. Also incorportes ideas from Tunnel Goons, World of Dungeons, KULT, and of course, City of Mist RPG.

## Summary

This world is like the comic book _Fables_ meets the tv show _Miami Vice_. 

Essentially it's a setting drift of **_City of Mist_**, the RPG by Amít Moshe, transported to a fictional version of 1980s Miami, Florida. The players are associated with a private detective agency located somewhere around South Beach, Wynwood, or Little Havana. The world of fables is real -- hidden as if behind a tropical mist. Threats might include a ghost pirate ship kidnapping tourists along the Caribbean beaches, or a gang of teenage ninja Kappa hiding in the sewers. Mysteries of myth coexist and intermingle with more mundane dangers including Italian Cosa Nostra or the Columbian cartel.

## Week 1: Pitch Points & Inspiration!

### What to know before you play

 * **Each player character has a "mythos"** -- a mystical force that gives you extraordinary abilities. This mythos must be based on a fable or archetype of legend such as Gilgamesh, Amaterasu, or Quetzalcóatl. Your character also has a logos, which represents your mundane human identity and obliglations to family or community. So, for example, during the daytime you might be a humble car mechanic, but by night you fight crime as the personification of Hephaestus, god of the forge.

 * **Pitch 2** -- lorem ipsem, booty.

 * **Pitch 3** -- lorem ipsem, booty.

 * **Pitch 4** -- lorem ipsem, booty.

### Inspiration: Player Facing

 * **City of Mist** -- specifically the Player's Guide and Starter Set.

 * **Miami Vice** and Burn Notice -- tv shows set in Miami with a similar vibe. Characters take on "cases" to defend the weak, explore the urban environment, chat up locals for gossip, and the occasional boat ride outside the city (both ocean and swamp).

 * **Jessica Jones**  -- tv shows featuring imperfect superheroes of moderate-to-low power who fight more grounded threats compared to their blockbuster counterparts. More street-level threats rather than big global villains. Private Detective agencies. Also: **Dare Devil** and season 1 of **Young Justice**.

 * **Fables** -- comic book very much in line with how superpowers are explained in the City of Mist setting

### Inspiration: GM Facing

 - **Nights of Payne Town** -- might try to adapt some of these scenarios such as "Killing Her Softly" and other crime-noir mysteries.

 - **Augmented Reality** -- solid quality random tables for generating cyberpunk settings, but some is applicable to a retro urban fantasy environment.

 - **Electric Bastionland** -- advice and procedures for creating city buroughs and dungeon-esque mapping in unusual urban environments.

 - **Google Earth and Wikipedia** -- because I'm adapting a real-world location into an original fictional universe. In my mind, the game world is connected to other urvan fantasy RPGs I've run (_Monster of the Week_, etc.), but these connections won't be important to players joiniing me for the first time.

#### Honorable Mentions

 - **Dexter, True Blood** -- the tv shows set in Miami and Louisiana hinting at a tropical Southern gothic mood.
 - **Watchmen / Tales of the Black Freighter** -- the "easter egg" story of a gentleman who transforms into a degenerate pirate, a fame narrative told by the comic-within-a-comic of Watchmen by Alan Moore.
 - **1980s Swamp Thing** -- wonderful comic books series that rebooted the swampland anti-hero, also written by Alan Moore.
 - __Godfather II__ -- interesting portrayal of the Cuban Revolution against the backdrop of Caribbean geopolitics and Italian organized crime.
 - **Narcos, Breaking Bad**, movies about Pablo Escabar -- stories of drug cartels and the rise and fall of dynasties wihin
