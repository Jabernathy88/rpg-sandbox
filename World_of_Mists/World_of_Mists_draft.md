# City of Mists Accelerated

## C.A.T.S.

### Concept

I want to port the setting of City of Mists to a fictional version of 1980s Miami, Florida. The players are associated with a private detective agency located somewhere around South Beach, Wynwood, or Little Havana. The world of fables is real, hidden as if behind a tropical mist. 

Threats might include a ghost pirate ship kidnapping tourists along the Caribbean beaches, or a gang of teenage ninja Kappa hiding in the sewers. Mysteries of myth coexist and intermingle with more mundane dangers including Italian Cosa Nostra or the Columbian cartel.
