_______________________________,

Pronouns: __________?

__Stress:__ 

0 / 6

__Armor:__

0 / 2

### Attributes

* Prowess: 0
* Insight: 0
* Resolve: 0

_(Distribute 4 dice points above. Max 3d in any attribute. If your pool is 0, roll 2d and keep the lowest die.)_

### Mythos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun)_

### Logos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Motorcycle Mechanic)_


_(For any Risky action, you may invoke either your Mythos or Logos, but never both. If so, add **1 extra die** to your pool.)_

__Mystery:__

_______________________________? 

 _(Worded as question that you continually seek to answer, inspired by your Mythos)_

__Refuge:__

3. _____________________: M / L?

4. _____________________: M / L?

_(For each above, label "M" for Mythos or "L" for Logos. At character creation, you must have at least **1 tag** representing both sides. Power Tags have no mechanical benefit other than describing the themes of your Mythos and Logos, and tracking the Balance between them. Powerful artifacts known as Relics are treated the same as Power Tags.)_

## Stress Costs

**1 Stress to push yourself.** Add 1 extra die to your roll. (Max 1 push per roll. Pushes must be declared before you roll dice.)

**1 Stress for a flashback** where you may attempt may one Risky action. The GM may charge 0 for some small flashbacks if the desired fiction is minor or simply to add flavor. (Any number of players may join in this flashback, but if they wish to lead or assist a roll, they must pay Stress as described below.)

**1 Stress to help another,** either in the present or in a flashback initiated by any player. Whoever is leading the action rolls their pool + 1 extra die. (Max 1 assist per roll, although the GM may allow exceptions based on the fiction.)

## Optional: Resisting a Consequence

To reduce the number of rolls during play, resisting a consequence is not always an option by default. But when it seems reasonable and follows the fiction, the GM may allow a Resistance roll from time to time. If unsure, err on the side of being generous.

Whenever you roll for Resistance, use the dice pool for the appropriate Attribute without adding any other bonus die. No matter what, you **always** succeed in resisting some or all of a consequence as established by the GM, and:

* **1-3:** Mark 3 Stress.
* **4-5:** Mark 1 Stress.
* **6:** No change in Stress.
* **Crit:** Refresh back 1 Stress.

## Seeking Refuge, sorta like Vices

If your character takes a couple days off without working a case, you automatically refresh 1 stress for free. 

If you choose to Seek Refuge in a more active way, you always roll **2d6**. For simplicity, this roll does not involve any Attributes or skills.

No matter the outcome, Seeking Refuge **always** refreshes your stress pool completely, and:

* **1-3:** Overindulge. GM picks the consequence.
* **4-5:** Overindulge. You pick the consequence. Describe the details: How does the balance between your Mythos and Logos begin to crack or fade?
* **6:** No consequence.
* **Crit:** The Crew also gains a new ally or earns 1 extra Cred. GM's choice, but you describe the details.

**When you Overindulge,** pick one:

* You attract unwanted attention from the authorities or some other faction. The GM might represent this as heat or by using a clock.
* Your character disappears for a month. Discuss with the GM what happened during this leave of absence.
* Add 3 XP to either Mythos or Logos, GM's choice. If you trigger foreground growth, describe a dramatic change that happens to your character at the most inconvenient time.
* You are cut off from your source of Refuge, and at least one of the Crew's allies now regards you unfavorably. This applies only to you and not the group as a whole. It will take effort to reestablish or change your source of Refuge.
* You rack up enormous debt that someone powerful wants to collect, and money won't be enough. You have to do something you won't like. The GM starts a new 8 piece clock.
* Someone important to the Crew gets hurt. They lose their home, go to the hospital (or jail), become enchanted with magical slumber, etc. The incident should delay progress on a current case or downtime project.

# XP and Foreground Growth

At the GM's discretion, you may earn **1 XP** per scene towards either Mythos or Logos. Foreground growth triggers when either rating reaches **6 XP**. 

Whenever this change occurs, reset both numbers to **0** and **rewrite** one of your Power Tags, your Mystery question, or your Source of Refuge. If your Power Tags changed, adjust your **Balance ratings** to reflect any shift in dominance between your Mythos and Logos. If the change and timing seems especially significant, the GM may suggest you rewrite the name of your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme, as well.

If your Balance shifts all the way toward Mythos, you lose control of your character as they are swept away by the living legend manifesting inside them. If you shift all the way toward Logos, your Mythos fades and your character loses the spark of power they once held dear.
