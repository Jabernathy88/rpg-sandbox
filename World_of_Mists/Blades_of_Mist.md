# Blades of Mist

## Stress

**1 Stress to push yourself.** Add 1 extra die to your roll. (Max 1 push per roll. Pushes must be declared before you roll dice.)

**1 Stress for a flashback** where you may attempt may one Risky action. The GM may charge 0 for some small flashbacks if the desired fiction is minor or simply to add flavor. (Any number of players may join in this flashback, but if they wish to lead or assist a roll, they must pay Stress as described below.)

**1 Stress to help another,** either in the present or in a flashback initiated by any player. Whoever is leading the action rolls their pool + 1 extra die. (Max 1 assist per roll, although the GM may allow exceptions based on the fiction.)

Optional: Attempt to Resist a consequence - not automatic, unlike other FitD games, although the GM may allow in special cases. Roll using Attributes only, no Skills.
**1-3:** Resist as established. Mark 3 stress.
**4-5:** Resist as established. Mark 1 stress.
**6:** Resist as established. No stress loss.
**Crit:** Also refresh back 1 stress.

## Seeking Refuge, sorta like Vices

If your character takes a couple days off without working a case, you automatically refresh 1 stress for free. 

If you choose to Seek Refuge in a more active way, you always roll **2d6**. For simplicity, this roll does not involve any Attributes or skills.

No matter the outcome, Seeking Refuge **always** refreshes your stress pool completely, and:
**1-3:** Overindulge. GM picks the consequence.
**4-5:** Overindulge. You pick the consequence. Describe the details: How does the balance between your Mythos and Logos begin to crack or fade?
**6:** No consequence.
**Crit:** The Crew also gains a new ally or earns 1 extra Cred. GM's choice, but you describe the details.
