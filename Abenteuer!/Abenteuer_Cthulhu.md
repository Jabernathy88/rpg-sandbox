# Abenteuer! Cthulhu

**Abstract**: This will be a 3 page (letter) micro game that combines:

 * Forged in the Dark dice pool

 * Stress from Messerspiel / Abenteuerspiel

 * Backgrounds from Jason Tocci's Agents of O.D.D.

 * Weapon damage from Into the Odd, but expanded to d12s and d14s, like DCC (possibly just d8x2 and 1d20?)

 * Investigation pushes like Lowell Frances's NBA Express

 * Skill names from Cthulhu Confidential by Pelgrane Press

 * Weapons and dynamite ala Pulp Cthulhu
