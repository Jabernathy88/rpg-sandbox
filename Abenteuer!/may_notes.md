Silly question, but just wanted to make sure we're working off of the v1.5 rules, right?

Perfect. Oh! Another "nice to have": one click randomizers for Rituals, Skills, and Equipment!

And rituals are now a two part roll in v1.5: action and subject.
So there would be two drop downs for selection.
 
Cool! Yeah, in my dream version of this, you could randomize both and then lock one of them that you like and keep randomizing the one you didn't like.

Along those lines... your character starts with 1 ritual, 2 skills, 3 equipment... but should be able to add more of those items through play. Maybe a "+" button for adding new fields? 

Skills and rituals would be drop downs (select from the pre-given options) but equipment should probably have the option for custom entry. (edited)

Just thinking about the dice rolling now too...

There's slots/check boxes for each of the 6 standard risky action questions... but devil's bargains basically add an optional 7th slot. (edited)

And then we should be able to tempt fate, but not until you have the results of your roll. Edit: And since tempting fate uses the stress die, it'll need to automatically adjust your pool depending on the outcome. (edited)

Oh! Back to the character area... we'll need an area to track conditions

And then back to the dice rolling area... a one click "replenish your pool" button would be super cool

as well as a simple d6 roller for the die of fate.

Yeah, maybe it doesn't actually update the result of a roll. But has it's own results area that simply reads: "Things get incrementally better/worse."
