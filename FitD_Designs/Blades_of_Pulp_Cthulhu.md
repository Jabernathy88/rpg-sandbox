## Death

### Zero HP

When you are at **exactly 0 HP**, roll a STR check. You may not use luck on this particular roll. The lower the better: 

* If you roll equal to or under your STR Attribute with no other bonuses, you succeed and are in great pain, but still standing. **-1d** to all rolls. 
* If the result is higher than your STR, you fail and pass out unconscious. If you don't receive medical attention within 1 hour, you die.
* Rolling a 1 always succeeds, even if if your STR is 0.
* Roilling a 6 always fails. (See special case below.)

### Negative HP

When your HP is negative (that is, **-1 or lower**), roll a STR check the same as with 0 except:

* Rolling a 6 means you die instantly. You may not usee luck on this particular roll.
