___________________________,

__Pronouns:__ ________.

__Stress:__ 

0 / 6

__Conditions:__

0 / 2

_(Marking the 1st condition reduces your dice pool by 1. The 2nd condition turns off your powers, preventing any benefits from your Mythos Theme. If you would mark a third condition, you are taken out.)_

__Armor:__

0 / 2

### Attributes

* Insight: 0
* Prowess: 0
* Resolve: 0

_(Distribute 4 dice points above. Max 3 dice in any single Attribute. For example, your distribution could be 2-1-1 or 3-1-0 in any order. If your dice pool is 0 or less, simply roll 2d6 and keep the lowest.)_

### Mythos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun)_

### Logos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Motorcycle Mechanic)_

_(For any Risky action, you may invoke **either** your Mythos or Logos, but never both. If so, add **1 extra die** to your pool.)_

__Mystery:__

_______________________________? 

 _(Worded as question that you continually seek to answer, inspired by your Mythos)_

## Mythos and Logos in Action

For any Risky action, you may invoke **either** your Mythos or Logos, but never both. If so, add **1 extra die** to your pool. 

Outside of dice rolls, your two Themes also grant narrative permissions on a case by case basis. For example, consider a character with the Mythos Theme of "Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun." She might easily be able to produce a flashlight-style effect with a snap of her fingers — no roll required. 

Groups should make decisions about what a character can and can't do based on the fiction and precedent — as understood and agreed by all players and not just the GM. If unsure, make a ruling to keep things moving, but definitely revisit the topic during downtime to make sure everyone is on the same page going forward.

## XP and Foreground Growth

At the GM's discretion, you may earn **1 XP** per scene towards either Mythos or Logos. Foreground growth triggers when either rating reaches **6 XP**. Whenever this change occurs, reset both numbers to **0** and **rewrite** one of your Power Tags, your Mystery question, or your source of Refuge. 

If your Power Tags change during this process, adjust your **Balance** ratings to reflect any shift in dominance between your Mythos and Logos. If your growth seems especially transformative, the GM may suggest that you rewrite the name of your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme to match the new fiction.

## Balance and Consequences

If your Balance tips all the way toward **Mythos** and your Logos rating drops to 0, **you lose control of your character.** Their former identity is swept away by the living legend manifesting inside of them. _(The GM will help you create a new character to resume play.)_

On the other hand, if your Balance completely shifts to **Logos** and your Mythos rating is 0, your character's mythic connection fades. **You lose your powers that you once held dear**. _(You may continue playing this character if you wish, but please discuss with the GM to decide the happiest, most practical option for moving forward.)_

## Stress Costs

* **1 Stress to push yourself.** Add **1 extra die** to your roll. _(Max 1 push per roll. Pushes must be declared before you roll.)_

* **1 Stress to start a Flashback** where you may attempt 1 Risky action. The GM may charge 0 Stress for a small flashback if the desired fiction is minor. _(Any number of players may join in this flashback, but if they wish to lead or assist any roll, they must pay Stress as described below.)_

* **1 Stress to help another PC,** either in the present or inside a Flashback. Whoever is leading the action rolls their pool, plus **1 extra die**. _(Max 1 assist per roll, although the GM may allow exceptions based on the fiction.)_

### Optional: Resisting a Consequence

To reduce the number of rolls during play, resisting a consequence is not always a default option. If it flows from the fiction, however, the GM may allow Resistance rolls from time to time. If unsure, it's often best to be generous.

**When you roll for Resistance,** use the dice pool for the appropriate raw **Attribute** without any other bonuses. No matter what, you **always** succeed _(you resist some or all of a consequence, as established by the GM)_, and:

* **1-3:** Mark 3 Stress.
* **4-5:** Mark 1 Stress.
* **6:** No change in Stress.
* **Crit:** Refresh back 1 Stress.

## Seeking Refuge, sorta like Vices

If your character takes a **2-3 days off** to relax without working a case, you automatically refresh **1 stress** for free. After that, there is no other mechanical benefit for taking a vacation. :-)

**When you Seek Refuge** to relieve stress in a more active way, you always roll **2d6**. For simplicity, this roll does not involve Attributes or any other bonuses. No matter what, your Refuge **always** refreshes your stress pool completely, and:

* **1-3:** Overindulge. GM picks the consequence.
* **4-5:** Overindulge. You pick the consequence. Describe the details: How does the balance between your Mythos and Logos begin to crack or fade?
* **6:** No consequence.
* **Crit:** The Crew gains a new ally or earns extra income. GM's choice, but you describe the details.

**When you Overindulge,** pick one, or roll to randomize if you prefer:

  **1.** You attract unwanted attention from the authorities or some other faction. The GM might represent this as abstract "heat" or by using a clock.
  **2.** Your character disappears for a month. Discuss with the GM what happened during this leave of absence.
  **3.** You are cut off from your source of Refuge, and at least one of the Crew's allies now regards you unfavorably. This applies only to you and not the group as a whole. It will take effort to reestablish or change your source of Refuge.
  **4.** You rack up enormous debt that someone powerful wants to collect, and money won't be enough. You have to do something you won't like. The GM starts a new 8-piece clock.
  **5.** Someone important to the Crew gets hurt. They lose their home, go to the hospital (or jail), become enchanted with magical slumber, etc. The incident should delay progress on a current case or downtime project.
  **6.** Add 3 XP to either Mythos or Logos, GM's choice. If you trigger foreground growth, describe a dramatic change that happens to your character at the most inconvenient time.

## Investigating

You may initiate an Investation roll explicitly, or the GM may rule that a player triggers it "automatically" — simply by exploring or asking questions about the world.

### Controlled, aka Just a Routine Search

**When you Investigate your surroundings in a Controlled position,** the GM makes a **1d6** Fortune Roll. They may include an **optional +1** modifier based on your character's background or any favorable context. No matter what, you **always** learn something new:

* **1-5:** Contiguous truth.
* **6:** Truth, with illuminating context.

After this initial roll, let the GM know if you want to push for more information. They may offer more details, without another roll, in exchange for **1 Stress** or **1 Clue Token** _(see below for details)_. 

Or, if they can think of an **interesting consequence** for your character spending the extra time, the GM may ask you to make an investigation roll in a **Risky** position. Otherwise, the spotlight should go to another player who may search for similar information if they describe a different approach.

_(Author's note: When I run games like this, I usually make this roll in the open. In the past, I've called it a "passive knowledge check," but the name isn't important. Sometimes it feels easier to ask a player to roll, and sometimes I do it myself. Sometimes I declare a small modifier out loud, but usually I just 'guestimate' the degree of success silently in the moment._

_Due to the nature of a mystery-style adventures, however, I do respect the use of secret rolls. I have used them myself from time to time. I usually don't care for bluffing with dice — that is, making a secret roll mainly to increase tension — but I think it's fine as long as you keep things moving, swiftly and smoothly. One of my design goals for including a Controlled variant, here, is to accomodate the occasional bluff for groups who enjoy that style.)_

**When you investigate your surroundings in a Risky position**, including risks or dangers that might surprise your character, roll your dice pool as normal. **Insight** is the default Attribute, although the GM may allow exceptions based on how you describe your approach. You may spend Stress to push yourself or invoke your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme _(but not both)_ as with any other Risky action. No matter what, you always learn something new:

* **1-3**: Contiguous truth, with consequences. 
* **4-5:** Contiguous truth.
* **6:** Truth, with illuminating context.
* **Crit:** Pierce the Mist. Player picks. If the GM isn't prepared to answer your question fully, they may give you a Clue token instead.

**When you Pierce the Mist,** your character learns all clues hidden in the current scene. Pick one of the following questions, or roll to randomize if you prefer. Before the GM answers, you or another player must tell them at least **1 theory**. , or roll to randomize if you prefer

--- PUT A BOOKMARK IN THIS. MAYBE I PREFER THE FORMAT IN CTHULHU DARK...... ---

* What is the current whereabouts of [name any person]...? 
* Who is the mastermind behind [name any wrongdoing]...?
* Who deserves the most credit for [name any good deed with mysterious origin]...?
