___________________________,

__Pronouns:__ ________.

__Stress:__ 

0 / 6

__Conditions:__

0 / 2

_(Marking the 1st condition reduces your dice pool by 1. The 2nd condition turns off your powers, preventing any benefits from your Mythos Theme. If you would mark a third condition, you are taken out.)_

__Armor:__

0 / 2

### Attributes

* Insight: 0
* Prowess: 0
* Resolve: 0

_(Distribute 4 dice points above. Max 3 dice in any single Attribute. For example, your distribution could be 2-1-1 or 3-1-0 in any order. If your dice pool is 0 or less, simply roll 2d6 and keep the lowest.)_

### Mythos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun)_

### Logos Theme: 

_______________________________. _(example: Motorcycle Mechanic)_

_(For any Risky action, you may invoke **either** your Mythos or Logos, but never both. If so, add **1 extra die** to your pool.)_

__Mystery:__

_______________________________? 

 _(Worded as question that you continually seek to answer, inspired by your Mythos)_

__Refuge:__

6. _____________________: M / L?

_(For each above, label "M" for Mythos or "L" for Logos. At character creation, you must have at least **1 tag** representing both sides. Power Tags have no mechanical benefit other than describing the themes of your Mythos and Logos, and tracking the Balance between them. Powerful artifacts known as Relics are treated the same as Power Tags.)_

## Mythos and Logos in Action

For any Risky action, you may invoke **either** your Mythos or Logos, but never both. If so, add **1 extra die** to your pool. 

Outside of dice rolls, your two Themes also grant narrative permissions on a case by case basis. For example, consider a character with the Mythos Theme of "Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun." She might easily be able to produce a flashlight-style effect with a snap of her fingers — no roll required. 

Groups should make decisions about what a character can and can't do based on the fiction and precedent — as understood and agreed by all players and not just the GM. If unsure, make a ruling to keep things moving, but definitely revisit the topic during downtime to make sure everyone is on the same page going forward.

## XP and Foreground Growth

At the GM's discretion, you may earn **1 XP** per scene towards either Mythos or Logos. Foreground growth triggers when either rating reaches **6 XP**. Whenever this change occurs, reset both numbers to **0** and **rewrite** one of your Power Tags, your Mystery question, or your source of Refuge. 

If your Power Tags change during this process, adjust your **Balance** ratings to reflect any shift in dominance between your Mythos and Logos. If your growth seems especially transformative, the GM may suggest that you rewrite the name of your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme to match the new fiction.

## Balance and Consequences

If your Balance tips all the way toward **Mythos** and your Logos rating drops to 0, **you lose control of your character.** Their former identity is swept away by the living legend manifesting inside of them. _(The GM will help you create a new character to resume play.)_

On the other hand, if your Balance completely shifts to **Logos** and your Mythos rating is 0, your character's mythic connection fades. **You lose your powers that you once held dear**. _(You may continue playing this character if you wish, but please discuss with the GM to decide the happiest, most practical option for moving forward.)_

## Stress Costs

* **1 Stress to push yourself.** Add **1 extra die** to your roll. _(Max 1 push per roll. Pushes must be declared before you roll.)_

* **1 Stress to start a Flashback** where you may attempt 1 Risky action. The GM may charge 0 Stress for a small flashback if the desired fiction is minor. _(Any number of players may join in this flashback, but if they wish to lead or assist any roll, they must pay Stress as described below.)_

* **1 Stress to help another PC,** either in the present or inside a Flashback. Whoever is leading the action rolls their pool, plus **1 extra die**. _(Max 1 assist per roll, although the GM may allow exceptions based on the fiction.)_

### Optional: Resisting a Consequence

To reduce the number of rolls during play, resisting a consequence is not always a default option. If it flows from the fiction, however, the GM may allow Resistance rolls from time to time. If unsure, it's often best to be generous.

**When you roll for Resistance,** use the dice pool for the appropriate raw **Attribute** without any other bonuses. No matter what, you **always** succeed _(you resist some or all of a consequence, as established by the GM)_, and:

* **1-3:** Mark 2 Stress.
* **4-5:** Mark 1 Stress.
* **6:** No change in Stress.
* **Crit:** Refresh back 1 Stress.

## Seeking Refuge, sorta like Vices

If your character takes a **2-3 days off** to relax without working a case, you automatically refresh **1 stress** for free. After that, there is no other mechanical benefit for taking a vacation. :-)

**When you Seek Refuge** to relieve stress in a more active way, you always roll **2d6**. For simplicity, this roll does not involve Attributes or any other bonuses. No matter what, your Refuge **always** refreshes your stress pool completely, and:

* **1-3:** Overindulge. GM picks the consequence.
* **4-5:** Overindulge. You pick the consequence. Describe the details: How does the balance between your Mythos and Logos begin to crack or fade?
* **6:** No consequence.
* **Crit:** The Crew gains a new ally or earns extra income. GM's choice, but you describe the details.

**When you Overindulge,** pick one, or roll to randomize if you prefer:

**1.** You attract unwanted attention from the authorities or some other faction. The GM might represent this as abstract "heat" or by using a clock.

**2.** Your character disappears for a month. Discuss with the GM what happened during this leave of absence.

**3.** You are cut off from your source of Refuge, and at least one of the Crew's allies now regards you unfavorably. This applies only to you and not the group as a whole. It will take effort to reestablish or change your source of Refuge.

**4.** You rack up enormous debt that someone powerful wants to collect, and money won't be enough. You have to do something you won't like. The GM starts a new 8-piece clock.

**5.** Someone important to the Crew gets hurt. For example, maybe they lose their home, end up in the hospital (or jail), or become enchanted with magical slumber. The incident should delay progress on a current case or downtime project.

**6.** Roll **1d6**. On **1-3**, you gain 3 Mythos XP. On **4-6**, you gain 3 Logos XP.If you trigger Foreground Growth, describe a dramatic change that happens to your character at the most inconvenient time.

## Investigating

You may initiate an Investigation roll explicitly, or the GM may rule that a player "triggers" it automatically — simply by exploring or asking questions about the world.

_(Author's note: The traditional Forged in the Dark mechanics of "position and effect" are not a formal part of these rules. I've included some familiar terms only as naming conventions, without intending any extra mechanical weight beyond that. For example, I'm using "Controlled" simply to describe situations that are relatively safe for the PCs, while "Risky" implies an element of danger or running out of time.)_

### Controlled, aka Just a Routine Search

**When you Investigate your surroundings, in a Controlled position,** the GM makes a **1d6** Fortune Roll. They may include an optional **1 extra die** based on your character's background or any favorable context. This roll may be made in secret, but the default is out in the open. No matter what, you **always** learn something new:

* **1-3:** Surface details.
* **4-5:** Surface details.
* **6:** **More truth**, with illuminating context.

Surface details include learning **everything** that might be hidden in the general area where your character is searching. Consider the following scene in a fancy CEO's office, for example:

 > _The GM decides beforehand that a **secret envelope** is taped to the underside of the CEO's computer desk. A character looking through files inside of the desk should always find that envelope. This player succeeds **even on a roll of 1**, and even without specifying they meant to look underneath the desk._
 _Earlier in the same scene, perhaps a different character decided to search the bookshelf first, on the other side of the room. On **1-3**, this player would **not** learn about the secret envelope. Instead, they would learn some short details about the books, as well anything hidden in, or behind, the bookshelf._
 _On a **4-5**, however, this second investigator might get a hint about checking the desk. And on a **6**, the GM might throw in a sticky note with the computer password, as well._

### Pushing for Extra Clues

If you investigate for a moment in character, but suspect you're still missing something, let the GM know if you want to **push yourself for more information**. They may offer more details, without another roll, in exchange for **1 Stress**. By default, spending Stress is the preferred method of obtaining core clues _(the really big "aha" moments that drive the story forward)_ while avoiding additional rolls.

Or — if they can think of an **interesting consequence** for your character spending some extra time — the GM may ask you to make an investigation roll with a **Risky** position _(see below)_. Otherwise, the spotlight should go to another player who may search for similar information if they describe a new alternate approach.

_(Author's note: When I run games like this, I usually make this roll in the open. In the past, I've called it a "passive knowledge check," but the name isn't important. Sometimes it feels easier to ask a player to roll, and sometimes I do it myself. Sometimes I declare a small modifier out loud, but usually I just 'guestimate' the degree of success silently in the moment._

_Due to the nature of a mystery-style adventures, however, I do respect the use of secret rolls. I have used them myself from time to time. I usually don't care for bluffing with dice — that is, making a secret roll mainly to increase tension — but I think it's fine as long as you keep things moving swiftly and smoothly. One of my design goals for including a Controlled variant, here, is to accomodate the occasional bluff for groups who enjoy that style.)_

### Risky, aka Investigating Under Pressure

When there are stakes involved while investigating, you may invoke your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme _(but not both)_, as normal. And you may spend Stress to push yourself as with any other Risky action.

**When you Investigate your surroundings in a Risky position**, including risks or dangers that might surprise your character, roll your dice pool as normal. **Insight** is the default Attribute for investigation _(although the GM may allow exceptions based on how you describe your approach)_. No matter what, you **always** learn something new:

* **1-3**: Surface details, with **consequences**.
* **4-5:** Surface details. **No** consequences, **and** you get a hint about where to look next.
* **6:** **More truth**, with illuminating context.
* **Crit:** Pierce the Mist. You succeed as above, but also get an extra glimpse of the past or a possible future. The GM can describe this extra knowledge as a psychedelic vision from beyond, or whatever seems fun and flavorful in the moment.

## Interviewing Witnesses and Suspects

There is no mechanical distinction between a witness and suspect. In the words of Gregory House M.D., "Everyone lies."

### Controlled, aka Just the Facts Ma'am

**When you Investigate by interviewing an NPC in a Controlled position,** the GM makes a **1d6** Fortune Roll. They may include an **optional +1** modifier based on the wording of your interview approach or any favorable context. This roll may be made in secret, but the default is out in the open. No matter what, you **always** learn something new:

* **1-3:** Rumors and opinions, mixed with lies.
* **4-5:** Rumors and opinions, **and** you learn if the NPC is concealing something important.
* **6:** Truth, with illuminating context. 

If the result is a strong success, the GM should decide if the NPC is aware that they've "given away" a clue. And, if so, do they care? If the answer is yes, then the GM should dial up the pressure immediately. 

### Risky, aka Difficult Conversations

As with other Risky actions, when there are stakes involved, you may invoke your Mythos Theme or Logos Theme _(but not both)_ and spend Stress to push yourself as with any other Risky action.

**When you Investigate by interviewing an NPC in a Risky position**, including risks or dangers that might surprise your character, roll your dice pool as normal. **Resolve** is the default Attribute for investigating through social interaction. No matter what, you **always** learn something new:

* **1-3:** Rumors, opinions, and lies, with **consequences**.
* **4-5:** Rumors, opinions, and lies. No consequences **And** you learn if the NPC is still concealing something important.
* **6:** Truth, with illuminating context. 
* **Crit:** Pierce the Mist. You succeed as above, but also get an extra glimpse of the past or a possible future. The GM can describe this moment as a cinematic montage. Or perhaps the NPC has a dormant Mythos of their own that suddenly takes over and compels them to tell the truth.

_(Author's note: In most of the games I run, I usually do **not** allow enhanced interrogation at my table. I would encourage GMs and players to talk through these scenes without resorting to torture._

_Either way, pursuasion isn't quite the same activity as interviewing purely to gather information. The rules above represent the gleaning of clues through clever questioning, body language, or, perhaps, verbal trickery._

_Convincing someone to do something they won't like — such as betraying their boss or a loved one — is better handled as a standard Risky roll. You might not be able to pursuade them without some kind of leverage, perhaps by offering them something they want in exchange. By contrast, finding out what an NPC really wants **would** be an excellent use of these rules.)_
